## Style rules

### Section full-width + .site-content

If you want a full-width section background, but content aligned like the other blocks, use a section with .site-content inside the full-width section 
```
some block or section with content
section (full-width)
  |
  |- section (with .site-content CSS class)
      |
      |- your content
```
